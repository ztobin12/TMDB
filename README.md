# Investigate a Dataset:TMDB
## Introduction
For my project I wanted to The Movie Database(TMDB) and see the relationship between amount of revenue a film makes and person the directing the film. I want to see who are the 20 directors who average the most per film, and I want to see if there is a correlation between the number of films made, by a director and the revenue brought in per film. In other words I want to see if name recognition mattered.
