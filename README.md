# Investigate a Dataset:TMDB
## Introduction
For my project I wanted to The Movie Database(TMDB) and see the relationship between amount of revenue a film makes and person the directing the film. I want to see who are the 20 directors who average the most per film, and I want to see if there is a correlation between the number of films made, by a director and the revenue brought in per film. In other words I want to see if name recognition mattered.
## Summary
- Eliminated directors who had less than 10 movies. Too many small one name directors that would skew the average.
- It turned out Peter Jackson who made the Lord of The Rings Trilogy was the highest earning director, followed by Stephen Spielberg
- It turned out there was little correlation between revenue made and the number of films a director has made as long as it was more than 10.
